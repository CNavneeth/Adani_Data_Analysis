# üìä Adani Stock Data - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for Adani stock data.  
The dataset contains stock market information such as opening price, closing price, high, low, volume, and more.  

Data cleaning ensures accuracy and consistency, while EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the data.

# **üßº Data Cleaning Process**
The following steps were performed to clean the data:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Staging Table**
- A copy of the original table is made to preserve raw data.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Duplicates & Remove Them**
- Identified duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER()` function.  
- Deleted duplicate records while keeping the first occurrence.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Standardizing Text Data**
- Trimmed whitespace from text columns.  
- Standardized company names and stock symbols for consistency.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Null Values**
- Replaced missing numerical values with `0`.  
- Replaced missing text values with `"Unknown"`.  
- Deleted records with critical missing values (`timestamp`, `symbol`, `company`).  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Date Format Standardization**
- Converted dates into standard SQL format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Check**
- Ensured all transformations were applied correctly.

# **üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
After cleaning, EDA was performed to analyze stock trends and patterns.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Basic Statistics**
- Counted the number of records, missing values, and distinct values.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Price Distribution**
- Calculated **minimum, maximum, mean, and median** for `open`, `close`, `high`, and `low` prices.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Performance Over Time**
- Identified top-performing stocks based on highest average closing price.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Most Volatile Stocks**
- Used standard deviation to measure volatility in stock prices.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Trading Volume Analysis**
- Identified days with highest and lowest trading volume.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Yearly Trends**
- Grouped stock data by year to analyze long-term trends.  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Between Prices**
- Checked if `open`, `close`, `high`, and `low` prices are correlated.  

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Impact of Dividends & Stock Splits**
- Analyzed how dividends and stock splits affected stock prices.  

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Outliers**
- Used interquartile range (IQR) to detect extreme stock price values.  

### **üîü Final Summary**
- Summarized key insights from EDA.
